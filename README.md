# Advent of Code by Abhiram Vattikonda

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels. These puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th each year. The problems vary in difficulty and often require creative algorithmic thinking.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by year and day, with each folder containing the corresponding Python scripts:
`
Advent-of-code/
├── 2021/
│   ├── day01.py
│   ├── day02.py
│   └── ...
├── 2022/
│   ├── day01.py
│   ├── day02.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
`
